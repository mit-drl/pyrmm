# Experiments

This directory holds benchmark environments for cross-testing different safety-based navigation algorithms (e.g. sampling-based learned risk metric maps, HJ-Reachability, Control Barrier Functions)

Note: the development and use of these environments is somewhat independent of the broader library. Therefore a separate conda environment is provided in `./environment.yml`
